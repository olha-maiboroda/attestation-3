        <h3>Reasons Why You Should Drink Coffee</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            And that’s not bad. In fact, there are many benefits to being part
            of the majority of the population drinking coffee every day. Coffee
            is excellent for the brain, the skin and the body. Here are 11
            reasons why you should get up every morning with a good coffee.
            According to an article in the journal ScienceDaily, released in
            2012, drinking coffee would help people with Parkinson’s disease
            control their movements. Ronald Postuma, author of the study, said:
            “Studies have already shown that caffeine users are less prone to
            developing Parkinson’s disease, but this is one of the first studies
            concluding that caffeine can be a cure for people already suffering
            from the disease.

        <h3>Coffee in Literature</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            Whether the beverage or the place, many writers, just as simple
            mortals, are lovers of coffee. Some like it hot, others prefer it
            icy. Simple routine, source of energy or inspiration, to enjoy with
            or without moderation in solitary or in society, coffee is a
            pleasure that writers taste each in their own way. First of all,
            coffee is a perfume, an aroma that some writers like to enhance.
            Alexandre Dumas exhibited his recipe for coffee frappé in his Grand
            Dictionnaire de Cuisine: a strong infusion of Mocha or Bourbon
            coffee, suitably sweetened with a third of creamy cream, in a bowl
            surrounded by crushed ice.

        <h3>The Story of Coffee in Hungary</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            The first Hungarian coffee house opened in 1714 and after a few
            years German and Italian coffee houses also opened their doors to
            the public of Pest. The coffee-drinking habit spread so quickly that
            more than 500 cafés and coffee dens were active by 1896. By then,
            coffee houses became centers of intellectual and social life. The
            next 200 years became the brightest era of domestic coffee culture.
            During this period the number of coffee shops in the capital
            increased 166-fold. Coffee houses as the New York Coffee House,
            Pilvax, Helvetia or Berger were the primary venues for socializing.
            From the early 19th century until World War II, the cultural life of
            Buda and Pest took place in the cafés.
